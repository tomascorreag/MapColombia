// ATMOSPHERE, NOT CARTOGRAPHY. Read this before changing anything here.
//
// These fields carry NO DATA. The real tendril field (tendrils.ts) grows from
// actual event coordinates, seeded in proportion to victim counts; the real
// ember raster (LossRasterLayer.ts) samples Hansen's 30 m tree-cover-loss
// pixels. The landing fetches neither — App.svelte deliberately short-circuits
// the data load when there is no ?section, and this module must never give it a
// reason to. Every wound point, loss year and density here is SYNTHETIC, drawn
// from a seeded PRNG and value noise.
//
// So these effects must never be readable as a map. Two rules enforce that:
//   1. Landing.svelte masks each field to the OUTER FLANK of its half — the
//      Colombia silhouette stays untouched, and no strand or ember is ever laid
//      over real geography.
//   2. Nothing here is labelled, scaled, or captioned as a quantity.
// They are an evocation of each archive's visual language, nothing more. The
// project's data-integrity rule (CLAUDE.md) is why this comment is this long.
//
// What IS faithful is the shape of the maths: the flow field (shared verbatim
// via noise.ts), the taper/pulse/envelope profiles from TendrilExtension.ts, and
// the fire ramp and burn maths from LossRasterLayer.ts (shared verbatim via
// fireRamp.ts). Constants below are marked [verbatim] where they are quoted from
// the real layer and [landing] where they are retuned for a looping 2D field —
// the retuned ones are all timing, because the real views are scrubbed by a user
// and this one runs on its own.
